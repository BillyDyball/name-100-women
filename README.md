# Name 100 Women

A fast little browser game: given 10 minutes, how many notable / influential women can you list? Your goal is to reach 100 before the timer expires. The timer only starts after your first submission so you can get ready.

## Gameplay
- Objective: enter 100 distinct full names of women in 10 minutes.
- Timer starts on your first attempt.
- Press Enter or click Verify to submit a name.
- Duplicate or unknown names are rejected.
- Press R (or the Reset button) any time to start over.
- Progress & personal best are stored locally in your browser (no accounts).
- Share button lets you copy / share a link and (if you win) your time.

## Tech Stack
